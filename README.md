B and W: A picture is worth a thousand words...
=====

- B and W is a web application that makes it incredibly easy and fast to upload photos to albums and share them with your friends.
- In addition, you can comment on your friends' photos, tag other users and other descriptors that pertain to the photos.
- Eventually, the descriptors on your photos and friends' photos will be able to create 'associations' between them. And if you
  give the app permission, we'll generate a graph of photos that relate to each other through your own tags! For instance, if
  you travel to a foreign country like Iceland and take photos of glaciers, your tags of the location and other aspects will
  link to other people's photos!
